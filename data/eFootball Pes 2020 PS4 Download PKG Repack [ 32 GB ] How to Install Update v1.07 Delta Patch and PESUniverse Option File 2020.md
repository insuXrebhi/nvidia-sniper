eFootball PES 2020 is the 19th installment of the Pro Evolution Soccer series, developed by Konami and released in September 2019. The game features a new game mode called Matchday, where players can choose a side and compete in online events based on real-life soccer matches. The game also boasts improved graphics, gameplay, physics and AI.
  
However, one of the drawbacks of eFootball PES 2020 is that it does not have all the official licenses for some of the major leagues and clubs, such as the English Premier League, the Spanish La Liga and the Italian Serie A.
