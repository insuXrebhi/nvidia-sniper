## Step 1: Download and Install Cheat Engine
 
You can download Cheat Engine from its official website: [https://www.cheatengine.org/](https://www.cheatengine.org/). Follow the instructions to install it on your PC. You may need to disable your antivirus software temporarily, as some programs may flag Cheat Engine as a potential threat.

Launch Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos or The Frozen Throne from your desktop or Start menu. Start a single-player campaign, custom game, or skirmish with cheats enabled. You can enable cheats by typing "-allowcheats" (without quotation marks) in the chat box before starting the game.

Open Cheat Engine from your desktop or Start menu. Click on the computer icon on the top left corner of the window to open the process list.

## Step 4: Scan for Values and Change Them
 
Now you can use Cheat Engine to scan for values and change them in Warcraft III. For example, if you want to change your gold amount, you can do the following:
 
- Look at your current gold amount in the game. Let's say it is 500.
- In Cheat Engine, enter "500" in the "Value" box and select "Exact Value" and "4 Bytes" as the scan type and value type respectively.
- Click on "First Scan" to search for all addresses that have the value 500.
- Go back to the game and spend or earn some gold. Let's say you now have 450 gold.
- In Cheat Engine, enter "450" in the "Value" box and click on "Next Scan" to narrow down the results.
- Repeat steps 5 and 6 until you have only one or a few addresses left in the results list.
- Select the address(es) that match your gold amount and double-click on them to add them to the address list below.
- In the address list, double-click on the value column of the address(es) you added and change it to any amount you want. Let's say you want 9999 gold.
- Go back to the game and check your gold amount. It should be changed to 9999.

You can use the same method to change other values such as lumber, hero levels, unit health, etc. You can also use Cheat Engine's features such as speedhack, debugger, trainer maker, etc. to further customize your game experience. However, be careful not to change too many values at once or make them too unrealistic, as it may cause the game to crash or become unstable.
 
## Conclusion
 
Cheat Engine is a powerful tool that can help you modify Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos and The Frozen Throne 1.27B in various ways. However, it is not intended for cheating in online multiplayer mode
